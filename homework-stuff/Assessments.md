Our senior design project is going to be designing a website for planning trips/events. Our idea is that we can input how much we’re looking to spend for something in the area and get all the relevant options back. This will definitely be a learning experience as I’m lacking in web development skills but I want to learn front end at some point so this seemed like a great experience. I’ve enjoyed building working projects from the ground up in classes and in co-ops so this will be a great opportunity. My cloud and scripting experience be immensely useful for this so it’s comforting to know part of the project can easily be accomplished. The reason for this project is that as a busy/working student, I often find myself questioning what to do when I finally get some free time and building something to curate a list will be immensely helpful.
	Personally I feel like 3 classes mainly stand out to me for this project and kind of guiding my career as a whole. Firstly, CS2028C, Data Structures, this class really sets the stage for anything and everything we do in programming as we’re always going be using lists or heaps or arrays to store data and without that class, I’d be missing a very fundamental building block. We’re going to have to be storing data somewhere that we pull/scrape for our project as well. The second class is EECE4029, Operating Systems. This was personally my favorite class I’ve taken in college so far. We got experience with Linux which was huge and even more important, we really dove into the low level behind the scenes with how processes work and communicate and really just makes you stop and think about what’s actually going on behind my programming. I use Linux to manage most of my AWS stuff so it also directly applies to this project. Finally, CS4065, Computer Networks, in my DevOps job we’re constantly using networking principles to make sure our infrastructure is secure and unable to be hacked or compromised. The same thing applies for this project in that we need to keep everything secure.
	My first two co-op rotations were with Crown Engineering Corporation and I did DevOps work with them for my first rotation, primarily building pipelines to automate builds and building AMIs to stand up elastic agents. My second rotation with them was an Embedded role and I did a lot of python scripting to parse binary data as well as making a GUI to make working with this data easier. My two main takeaways from that job was minor AWS experience and relevant Python scripting. This carried over into my 2nd and current company, Sierra Nevada Corporation. I work as a DevOps co-op for them, primarily working in AWS and creating infrastructure to host and run a variety of different things as well as creating some data visualization dashboards. My main takeaways from this job have been cloud experience and network security as well. Soft skills that I have learned are, teamwork, collaboration, how to ask for help among others.
	My motivation for this project really comes from 2 things. Number one is that I enjoy building fully functioning solutions and I think its really cool to see something progress from the ground up. I learn so much more from troubleshooting and doing something wrong, which is why I like co-op so much more then classes since we’re not getting points taken off if I do something wrong. The second reason is I really want to get some front end experience and I’ve never been able to before. Designing a website and building it will be phenomenal experience for myself and to put on my resume. There’s so many different components to web design and I know I’ll come away with good experience in all the main ones. 
	Our preliminary approach is to build a working back end first. We need to decide if we’re relying more on webscraping, api requests, or a combo of the two. After we do this, and can repeatedly demonstrate that its working without fail, then we can start moving into a more design phase. Actually creating the website, and learning how to link api requests to our website and all that good stuff. The final step will then be constructing cloud infrastructure to host everything as needed. I think we’re all pretty honest with ourselves and each other. We’re going to be done when we have something that we’re proud of, that works as it should, and that looks good as well.

Our senior design project's main objective is to create a dynamic website that resembles Tripadvisor, a well-known platform for user-generated travel reviews and suggestions. Our extensive academic background in computer science and web development, as well as the wide range of skill sets, we developed through co-op placements, are all included in this senior design project. We hope to create an immersive and user-centric platform for travelers to explore, review, and share their trips through our project, which is inspired by our mutual enthusiasm for technology and a profound admiration for traveling. Features like restaurant and hotel ratings are something we wish to include. 
Our academic journey as computer science majors has furnished us with the essential technical knowledge and robust problem-solving skills needed for this project. Courses such as Python Programming (CS 2021) have helped us understand the Python language which we will be using to code this. In that class we learned how we can use python to code websites and it is probably the easiest language to code in. Furthermore, CS2028C Data Structures has helped understand the foundation of coding and how it will be needed to create this project. In a project that involves collecting and organizing large amounts of data, understanding data structures is crucial. Data structures taught us how to choose the right way to store and retrieve information efficiently. For example, we might use data structures like arrays, lists, or trees to manage user profiles, reviews, and location data on the website. Knowing how to organize this data optimally can significantly improve your website's performance. Lastly, classes like CS4071 Design and Analysis of Algorithms class equipped us with the skills to develop efficient, responsive, and user-friendly features for our travel website. These algorithms can help us enhance user experiences, optimize resource usage, and manage the growing volume of data that such a platform would inevitably encounter.
My co-op experiences at Ameritas Insurance, where I worked as a Cyber Security Intern, have played a pivotal role in shaping my readiness for the multifaceted challenges inherent in this senior design project. These experiences have not only fortified my technical prowess but have also underscored the significance of effective teamwork, project management, and clear communication when constructing intricate web applications. At Ameritas Insurance, my role as a Cyber Security Intern primarily focused on the organization's cybersecurity measures. While the role didn't involve full-stack web development, it provided me with a deep understanding of security protocols and measures, which is invaluable for ensuring the safety and integrity of our upcoming project. This unique perspective complements our team's skill set, enhancing our ability to build a robust and secure travel website. At Ameritas I led a project for 6 months and completed it. This helped me understand team collaboration and how to manage a team. This skill will be helpful in this project. 
My drive for this senior design project comes from a mix of my tech skills and a genuine passion for travel and discovery. It all started during my internship at Ameritas Insurance, where I served as a Cyber Security Intern. This unique experience gave me insight into safeguarding systems and data, which is pivotal for ensuring the security of our upcoming project. Our project kicks off with thorough market research to spot gaps in existing travel recommendation platforms. We're gearing up to craft a user-friendly website loaded with cool features: think personalized user profiles, spot-on location-based search, and a review system that truly rocks. Two things we won't compromise on. Data accuracy and seamless user experience. Our big vision is to create an all-in-one platform that empowers travelers to make smart choices and share their epic travel stories within a global community of like-minded adventurers.
For us, keeping track of our progress is key. We've set clear project milestones, including getting those essential features up and running, running thorough user tests, and making sure the site runs like a dream. Success for us isn't just about the technical stuff; it's about how much our users love it. We'll be chatting with our fellow students and mentors to get feedback and keep making our platform better. Our main goal? Delivering a website that's as awesome as it is user-friendly, making every traveler's journey even more epic. In summary, our senior design project, which is all about making a website like Tripadvisor, really shows how much we're into using our tech skills for solving real-world stuff. It's like we're combining all the things we learned in class with what I did during my internship at Ameritas Insurance. This project is like the perfect mix of college and real-life experiences, and it's a sign of how much we want to use tech to make things better for regular folks. We're pumped to make a website that travelers can totally rely on and have a blast using to plan their adventures. It's all about our love for tech and wanderlust, and we can't wait to share it with the world!

For the senior project, I will be working on team PBJ with Jacob Kennedy and Parth Patel. Our current idea is to utilize web dev, cloud services, and cybersecurity to create a travel adviser website/service. This will involve creating a visually appealing front end using HTML and CSS as well as developing a through back end utilizing various APIs from large travel services such as Yelp and AirBnB. With these APIs we should be able to gather information regarding different information at various travel sites. This information can be used to provide users with advice on what to do in a particular area. We could also provide links or helpful information to users for signing up for different activities in an area.
    College curriculum will likely not play a large part in this project. Many of the courses provided focus more on traditional programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python so there is not much focus on web development. Since we’ll likely be working with HTML, CSS, javascript, databases, and cloud services, college curriculum will mostly just serve as a basis for learning and working with these additional tools. The main takeaways from college will be working on coding projects as well as working in a group of individuals. Many concepts in software development are consistent across different programming languages. This means I will be  able to apply what I’ve learned with C++, Java, and Python to the development of this project. With the associated skills and knowledge I should be able to aid in developing a complete product.
    In regards to co-op experience, I have been able to work with a team of individuals and complete assignments in bug fixing as well as project development. This helped me gain a good amount of insight on how to work in a team including what is important during different steps if project development. Additionally, the project had an HTML side for diagnostic output which helped me get a bit of experience working with HTML and CSS. It wasn’t the level of web development that I believe will be used for our project, however I think the brief experience helped introduce me to HTML. With this introduction I can do self-learning to be able to work on a website well enough to be suitable for our project.
    I am interested in working on this project because I have always wanted to become more experienced in web development and cloud services. Cloud services have become a very important part of modern software so I think that gaining at least some experience can help me become more successful in my career. Additionally, I like the thought of working on web dev because of the combination of visually appealing front end along with a practical and functional back end. With my history of programming, I’ve never had a large focus on UI and visual display just due to the nature of my assignments. So I think it will be good to get experience on this side of software development.
    To be honest, we have not yet formally discussed a preliminary approach to this project. For now, I will just approach it as I always have with my software assignments and just be prepared to learn various software concepts. I think being open to learning quickly and effectively is one of the most important attributes when working in software development. In terms of results, I hope to fully flesh out our project idea. The whole scope of our project isn’t defined yet, so I don’t have an exact idea of the end result and this will just need to be developed over time. Regarding my individual assessment, I will keep track of what I am assigned to complete and make sure I make a sufficient amount of progress over a period of time. My goal is to create a visually appealing product that works well and is intuitive to use. These are the main elements that I will use to assess whether or not I have done a good job on this project.
